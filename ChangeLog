-------------------
Version: 1.1-2
Date: 2012-09-18

	* Now exporting accessor functions for 'msSurv'
	* Changed license from GPL-3 to GPL-2
	* Added citation to JSS publication for msSurv (JSS 50:14, 2012)
	* Included modified JSS paper as package vignette
	* Changed all occurrences of 'sum.dNs' to 'sum_dNs' to avoid
	conflict with S3 generic 'sum'
	* Added package 'KMsurv' to the 'Suggests' field in the
	DESCRIPTION file

-------------------
Version: 1.1-1
Date: 2012-06-25

	* Modified output of 'print', 'show', and 'EntryExit' slightly

-------------------
Version: 1.1-0
Date: 2012-04-18

	* Changed name of function 'st.t' to 'SOPt'
	* Changed name of internal function 'stocc' to 'AJ.estimator'
	* Removed internal function 'Dist.BS.var'
	* Modified all functions to make more extensive use of vectorized
	calculations
	* Output now returned invisibly for functions Pst, SOPt, and
	EntryExit
	* Added accessor functions for ALL slots in msSurv objects.
	* Updated code throughout to use accessor functions rather than
	make explicit reference to slot names.
	* Updated functions throughout msSurv package so that the labels
	accessed the state names instead of column / array index locations.
	* Changed required names for data columns to 'id', 'start',
	'stop', 'start.state', and 'end.state' ('start' is optional for
	right-censored only data)
	* Removed arguments 'start.states' and 'd.var' from function
	msSurv.
	* Added argument 'bs' to determine whether bootstrapping is
	used to calculate the variance.  Bootstrapping is currently needed
	for the variance of the A-J estimators when there is dependent
	censoring, for the variance of the state entry / exit functions,
	and for the variance of the state occupation probabilities when
	there is > 1 possible starting state.
	* Starting proportions in each state (prior to the first observed
	transition time) are now calculated empirically based on the data
	* In class msSurv, changed names for the following slots: 'out' to
	'cov.AJs', 'cov.p' to 'var.sop', 'all.ajs' to 'AJs', and
	'all.I_dA' to 'I.dA'.
	* Added the computation and appropriate applications and output
	for non-normalized state entry and exit distributions (referred to
	as subdistributions).  These are now calculated and stored in the
	'Fsub' and 'Gsub' slots, respectively, in msSurv objects.  Options
	for plotting subdistribution functions, and for calculating them
	using the EntryExit function, have been added, along with
	appropriately named accessor functions.
	* Changed notation for normalized state entry and exit
	distributions from 'Fs' and 'Gs' to 'Fnorm' and 'Gnorm'.  Added
	accessor functions Fnorm and Gnorm.
	* Changed the normalization for the state exit distributions
	('Gnorm') so that it matches that used for the state entry
	distributions.  That is, the denominator consists of all
	individuals who will ever *enter*, not necessarily leave, a state.
	* Added the 'norm=TRUE' argument to the Dist.CIs function to allow
	users to specify whether they want normalized entry/exit
	distributions or if they prefer the non-normalized
	subdistributions.
	* Added "->" to output for print and show methods to clearly
	identify transitions between states.
	* Added a check and corresponding error message when users request
	'bs=TRUE' with fewer than 10 subjects
	* Added a check to ensure that all start times are earlier than
	the stop times
	* Now requiring users to insert a " " between transitioning states
	they want to plot in the 'plot' function to clearly distinguish
	transitions, e.g. "1 12" instead of "112"
	* Modified argument "plot.type" in plot method for msSurv objects
	to include possibilities 'entry.sub', 'entry.norm', 'exit.sub', or
	'exit.norm' for state entry and exit plots.
	* Created a "State Entry and Exit Distribution" section of the
	summary method and removed that information from the "State
	Occupation Probability" section.
	* Modified 'print' and 'show' methods to display sparse output
	concerning the msSurv object, and 'summary' to give more detailed
	information. Added arguments to the summary method to allow users to
	customize displayed output, including options for displaying /
	hiding the transition probabilities, state occupation
	probabilities, state entry / exit distributions, and Datta-Satten
	weighted estimates of the counting processes.  Additionally, users
	can specify at which timepoints they want summary information.
	* Updated author contact information in the description file.
